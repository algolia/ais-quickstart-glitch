Welcome to the Algolia quickstart
=========================

**Algolia** is a hosted search api that gives you access to instant search experience by just setting a few variables. Take data you want to use and make it searchable!

We have instructions below and some friends throughout the code helping you along the way.

**Jean the Developer** ＼(＾▽＾)／ will show you in the code the step numbers for where you are below!

**Jacques the Explorer** ✺◟( • ω • )◞✺ helps you explore the code base and get useful tips for what is happening in certain functions.

We recommend splitting your screen and using one tab for code and your console and the other for following along at the homepage.
