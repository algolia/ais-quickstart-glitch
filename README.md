Welcome to the Algolia quickstart
=========================

**Algolia** is a hosted search api that gives you access to instant search experience by just setting a few variables. Take data you want to use and make it searchable!

We have instructions below and some friends throughout the code helping you along the way.

**Jean the Developer** ＼(＾▽＾)／ will show you in the code the step numbers for where you are below!

**Jacques the Explorer** ✺◟( • ω • )◞✺ helps you explore the code base and get useful tips for what is happening in certain functions.
