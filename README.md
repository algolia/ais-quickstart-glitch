Welcome to the Algolia quickstart
=========================

**Algolia** is a hosted search api that gives you access to instant search experience by just setting a few variables. Take data you want to use and make it searchable!

We have instructions on the homepage and some friends throughout the code base helping you along the way.

**Jean the Developer** ＼(＾▽＾)／ will show you the place in the code that each step corresponds to.

**Jacques the Explorer** ✺◟( • ω • )◞✺ helps you explore the code base and get useful tips for what is happening in certain functions.


Visit homepage for remixing instructions!
------------
We recommend splitting your screen and using one tab for code and your console and the other for following along at the homepage.
